The ROS2 launch system is significantly different than that of ROS, but at this time the Python API documentation is sparse.  I'm working through the [MBZIRC simple demo](https://github.com/osrf/mbzirc/wiki/Running-the-Demo) as a way to understand the system by example.

## Quickstart

### Original launch file with comments

I've added verbose comments to the [MBZIRC simple demo](https://github.com/osrf/mbzirc/wiki/Running-the-Demo) launch file as an exercise in understanding this particular example.  The modified launch file is [mbzirc_demo.launch.py](https://github.com/bsb808/mbzirc_demo/blob/main/launch/mbzirc_demo.launch.py) and can be run with

```
ros2 launch mbzirc_demo mbzirc_demo.launch.py ign_args:="-v 4 -r mbzirc_oceandemo.sdf"
```

### Refactored launch file

The use of the OpaqueFunction substitution seemed unnecessarily complicated and the Ament path finding seemed inconsistent with the launch substitution design, so I refactored the launch file, which I think is simpler: 

```
ros2 launch mbzirc_demo mbzirc_demo_refactor.launch.py ign_args:="-v 4 -r mbzirc_oceandemo.sdf"
```

### Notes on `ros2 launch`

You can also see the available launch arguments with `ros2 launch mbzirc_demo mbzirc_demo.launch.py -s`

```
Arguments (pass arguments as '<name>:=<value>'):

    'ign_args':
        Arguments to be passed to Ignition Gazebo
        (default: '')
```

Or get a description of the LaunchDescription with `ros2 launch mbzirc_ros competition_local.launch.py -p` which, in this case isn't terribly helpful...

```
<launch.launch_description.LaunchDescription object at 0x7fc2741a8700>
├── Action('<launch.actions.declare_launch_argument.DeclareLaunchArgument object at 0x7fc274d29d90>')
└── Action('<launch.actions.opaque_function.OpaqueFunction object at 0x7fc274d29c40>')
```



## Resources

### Background

* The [ROS 2 Launch System Design](https://design.ros2.org/articles/roslaunch.html) is helpful to understand the goals of the new system.
* The [Architecture of launch](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/doc/source/architecture.rst) document describes the main classes and methods involved in the `launch` functionality.
* https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros

### Examples

* The ROS2 How-To-Guide [Using Python, XML and YAML for ROS 2 Launch Files](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/How-To-Guides/Launch-file-different-formats.html) provides an example that is incrementally more complex than the simplest examples.
* [Michael Ferguson's](http://www.robotandchisel.com/) ROS 2 Cookbook includes a [roslaunch2 page](https://github.com/mikeferguson/ros2_cookbook/blob/main/pages/launch.md) that illustrates useful functions such as including other launch files, loading parameters, etc.

## Main Components and Concepts

### LaunchDescription - What is to be launched

All launch files include the `generate_launch_description()` function which returns and instance of the [`LaunchDescription` class](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/launch/launch_description.py).  The pydoc string says:

```
class LaunchDescription(LaunchDescriptionEntity):
    """
    Description of a launch-able system.
    The description is expressed by a collection of entities which represent
    the system architect's intentions.
```


### Actions - How the system is to be launched

As described in [Architecture of launch](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/doc/source/architecture.rst), actions express intention of the user.  These classes inherit from the [Action](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/rolling/launch/launch/action.py) base class.  This example uses a few, but the source suggests more and the [ROS 2 Launch System Design](https://design.ros2.org/articles/roslaunch.html#actions) inlcudes a section on the the framework.


#### Action: DeclareLaunchArgument

Syntax of this the class init parameters is similar to argparse for describing command line arguments (defaults, desriptions, etc.)  These objects are added directly to the LaunchDescription.  The pydoc string of [declare_launch_argument.py](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/rolling/launch/launch/actions/declare_launch_argument.py) provides description and examples.

#### Action: IncludeLaunchDescription

Enables including another launch description source.  The common idiom seems to be to combine this with the `PythonLaunchDescriptionSource` to include another Pyton launch file, e.g.,

```
return LaunchDescription([
    IncludeLaunchDescription(
        PythonLaunchDescriptionSource('example.launch.py'))])
```


### Substitutions - Allowing for context

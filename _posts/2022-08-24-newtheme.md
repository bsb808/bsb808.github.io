Inspired by this [post](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-website-with-Minimal-Mistakes-Jekyll-Theme-HOWTO-Part-I/), I wanted to change this site's theme.

I chose the Gem-based installation method from the [minimal-mistakes repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Required slight reformatting of the posts and pages.

Also used the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) for hints of formatting and note on [Configuring GitHub Metadata] to avoid `No GitHub API authentication...` warnings.
